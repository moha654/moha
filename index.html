    <section id="what-is-cms">
      <h2>What is a CMS Platform and Why It’s Popular</h2>
      <p>
        A content management system (CMS) is an application that is used to manage content, allowing multiple contributors to create, edit and publish. Content in a CMS is typically stored in a database and displayed in a presentation layer based on a set of templates like a website.
        <br><br>
        A CMS platform enables you to create websites without having prior coding knowledge. Usually, web pages are written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages. So, if you want to create a website, you have to know at least these programming languages.
        <br><br>
        CMS removes this barrier. Now you can create a website without writing a single line of code using a CMS platform, no matter if you are a teacher, lawyer, entrepreneur, or student. This feature of CMS platforms makes them so popular nowadays.
      <img src="Growth-rate-of-CMS-platforms-1024x576.png" alt="">
        If you focus on the above pie chart, you can easily understand how CMS platforms are dominating the web.
        <br><br>
        Combinedly, CMS has 68.9% of the market share. And non-CMS has 31.1% of the total market share.
        <br><br>
        Also, most CMS platforms are easy to use, easy to maintain, open source, and secure. This is why more than 70 Million live website owners are using CMS to create and manage their websites.

      <img src="An-example-of-WordPress-how-it-looks-like-1024x462.png" alt="">

        <br><br>
        Initially, WordPress was released as a blogging site. But after the successive releases of WordPress new versions, nowadays it’s used for creating all types of websites, from small websites like portfolios to complex websites like eCommerce stores with tons of products.
